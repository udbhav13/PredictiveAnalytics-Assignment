I disagree with the on-staff stats guru on some points mentioned
below:  
Which Cluster is the location in:  
The excel guru looks at the rent of the whole market and fails to
consider cluster in the whole economic calculation. Each cluster has a
different rent spectrum. Moreover, the green building in each cluster
has a different trend of market rate as compared to the non-green
buildings in the same cluster. In some clusters, green buildings are
less expensive than the others and in others the difference is very
different from others. So $2.6 more per squarefoot is a vague estimate.
It can easily be more or less depending on the cluster.

assume minimum occupancy rate of 90%?  
Half of the properties have below 90% occupancy rate. Though green
properties are more occupied than non-green but still 90% is a very
large assumption on part of the stats-guru. Moreover, some clusters
don’t have that much occupancy, which can mean that there is not much
demand in those clusters ruling out the idea of investing in those
clusters.

Who pays the utility bills?  
The stats-guru does not take into account whether the utility bills are
paid by renter or not. Rents are obviously higher for utility cost
included in rent. There seem to be both green and non-green buildings in
the two categories. We need to account for utility charges if either
case is there.

cost and Gas costs  
Both Electricity and Gas costs are different for different clusters.

![](Final_q1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- --> Do all
clusters have equally tall buildings?  
Each cluster has a different range of stories of a building. As a trend,
green buildings are usually taller cluster-wise. The trend in the story
reflects the demand in the area and there also might be additional legal
restrictions in some areas as well.

CONCLUSION  
\-The recommendation put forward by the stats guru seems pretty vague
and incomplete. He fails to consider factors which might have an
economic impact both positively and negatively.  
\-He did not consider the cluster-wise distribution of rents and then
the difference of green and non-green property’s rent.  
\-His assumption of atleast 90% occupancy seems vague.  
\-He does not account utility costs nor does he consider whether it is
included in the rent or not.  
\-All clusters do not have high sky scrapers. One hypothesis is that it
can indicate demand or legal restrictions.
